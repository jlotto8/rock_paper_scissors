'''
Write a program that calculates avrg ht from a List of heights.
Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.
Example Input 1
156 178 165 171 187
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]
Example Output 1
total height = 857
number of students = 5
average height = 171
Example Input 2
151 145 179
Example Output 2
total height = 475
number of students = 3
average height = 158
'''
# student_hts = [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]
# sum_ht = 0
# count = 0
# for height in student_hts:
#     sum_ht += height
#     count += 1
# print(count)
# print(sum_ht)
# average = sum_ht/count
# print(round(average))

'''
Write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions.
The highest score in the class is: x
Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
Example Output
The highest score in the class is: 
'''
# Input a list of student scores
# student_scores = input().split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
#   student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

# highest = 0
# for score in student_scores:
#   if highest < score:
#     highest = score
# print(f'The highest score in the class is: {highest}')

# target = int(input()) # Enter a number between 0 and 1000
# # 🚨 Do not change the code above ☝️

# # Write your code here 👇
# total = 0
# for i in range(1,target+1):
#   if i%2 == 0:
#     total += i
# print(total)
